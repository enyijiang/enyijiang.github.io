Miscellaneous

My favorite quote: **Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. (Romans 12:2 NIV)**

Enjoy the fellowship time @ [ICCF](https://iccfer.com/). Part-time piano player (record piano version of Christian/Pop music). Write kinds of stuff from time to time. [[Music Radio](https://music.163.com/#/djradio?id=960850566)] [[Random Blogs/Poems](https://enyijiang.web.illinois.edu/)]

I enjoy music, long-distance running, ice skating, traveling, journaling, and reading in my free time.
