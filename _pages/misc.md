My Faith
======
My family are all Christians so we **always** take the things of God most seriously. I went to church since I was very young and began serving God when I was 10.

* From my primary school to middle school, I was a member of treble in a children choir. 
* During my high school and most of my undergraduate period, I played keyboard in a teenager worship team.
* From the start of covid-19, I started to write wechat blog regularly, sharing my faith and life. You are welcome follow my WeChat official account named **MoherLight**. However, it is mostly about Christianity.

* I am a fanatical music lover and an amateur piano player. I learned classic piano during my childhood. 
* Piano is one of my best friends! I have a [personal music radio](https://music.163.com/#/djradio?id=960850566) with Christian worship songs (light music version).
* You can also follow me on NetEase Music. My artist name is [MoherLight](https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=34142415). I improvise some light music of my own style from time to time.
