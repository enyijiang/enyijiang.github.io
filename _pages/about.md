**Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. - Romans 12:2 NIV**

I am now a first-year Computer Science M.S.(with thesis) graduate student at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). My current research interest is applied machine learning.

<!-- I completed my undergraduate study from [ZJU-UIUC Institute](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/content/972) at [International Campus of Zhejiang University](https://www.intl.zju.edu.cn) located in Haining, Zhejiang, China. As a student of [ZJU-UIUC](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/content/972) dual-degree program, I got Bachelor of Sicence degree in Computer Engineering with [Highest Honors](https://ece.illinois.edu/admissions/why-ece/honors) from [ECE Department](https://ece.illinois.edu/) of [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) and Bachelor of Engineering degree with honors in Electronics and Computer Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn).
