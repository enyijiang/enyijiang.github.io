**Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. (Romans 12:2 NIV)**

I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at <a href="https://illinois.edu/" style="text-decoration:none">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, working with <a href="https://ggndpsngh.github.io/" style="text-decoration:none">Prof. Gagandeep Singh</a>. Currently, I am broadly interested in exploring different aspects of trustworthiness in machine learning.

Before that, I got my Master of Science degree in the same department. My Master research concentrates on federated learning for healthcare applications, with a focus on federated domain adaptation (FDA) problem both empirically and theoretically, advised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/index.html" style="text-decoration:none">Prof. Sanmi Koyejo</a>. I completed my undergraduate study from <a href="https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/content/972" style="text-decoration:none">ZJU-UIUC Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.intl.zju.edu.cn" style="text-decoration:none">International Campus of Zhejiang University</a> located in Haining, Zhejiang, China. As a student of <a href="https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/content/972" style="text-decoration:none">ZJU-UIUC Institute</a> dual-degree program, I got a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering with <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/admissions/why-ece/honors" style="text-decoration:none">Highest Honors</a> from <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/" style="text-decoration:none">ECE Department</a> of <a href="https://illinois.edu/" style="text-decoration:none">UIUC</a> and Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn" style="text-decoration:none">Zhejiang University</a>.
