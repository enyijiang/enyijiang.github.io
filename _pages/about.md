I am now a first-year Computer Science M.S.(with thesis) graduate student at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). My current research interests are in NLP/ML/CV. I am still on my way to become a good researcher.


<!-- I completed my undergraduate study from [ZJU-UIUC Institute](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/content/972) at [International Campus of Zhejiang University](https://www.intl.zju.edu.cn) located in Haining, Zhejiang, China. As a student of [ZJU-UIUC](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/content/972) dual-degree program, I got Bachelor of Sicence degree in Computer Engineering with [Highest Honors](https://ece.illinois.edu/admissions/why-ece/honors) from [ECE Department](https://ece.illinois.edu/) of [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) and Bachelor of Engineering degree with honors in Electronics and Computer Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn).
