I am a second-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at <a href="https://illinois.edu/" style="text-decoration:none">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, working with <a href="https://ggndpsngh.github.io/" style="text-decoration:none">Prof. Gagandeep Singh</a>. I am broadly interested in trustworthy machine learning. My research goal is to build robust, certifiable, and interpretable machine learning systems. 

Before that, I got my Master of Science degree in the same department. My Master research concentrates on federated learning for healthcare applications, with a focus on federated domain adaptation (FDA) problem both empirically and theoretically, advised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/index.html" style="text-decoration:none">Prof. Sanmi Koyejo</a>. Also, I got a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering with <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/admissions/why-ece/honors" style="text-decoration:none">Highest Honors</a> from <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/" style="text-decoration:none">ECE Department</a> of <a href="https://illinois.edu/" style="text-decoration:none">UIUC</a>.
