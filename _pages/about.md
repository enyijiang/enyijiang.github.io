**Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. (Romans 12:2 NIV)**

I am now a first-year Computer Science M.S.(with thesis) graduate student at <a href="https://illinois.edu/" style="text-decoration:none">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. My current research interest is machine learning and its applications.
