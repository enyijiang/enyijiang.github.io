## Some Basics

### Real-Ideal Paradigm

**Ideal World**. The parties securely compute the function $\mathcal{F}$ by privately sending their inputs to a completely **trusted** party $\mathcal{T}$, who who simply computes $\mathcal{F}(x_1, x_2, ....x_n)$ and returns the result to all parties (**Functionality**).

**Real World**. There is **no trusted party**. All parties communicate with each other using a protocol $\pi$, specifying for each party a "next message" function $\pi_{i}$.

Input: security parameter $\kappa$, the partyâ€™s private input $x_i$, a random tape, and the list of messages received so far.

Output: next message to send with destination or terminate the party with some output.

### Semi-Honest Adversary

A **semi-honest adversary** is one who corrupts parties but **follows** the protocol as specified. *honest-but-curious*: may try to learn as much as possible from the messages they receive.

### View of a Party & the Adversary
**Real World**:
The *view* of a party consists of its private input, its random tape, and the list of all messages received during the protocol. The *view of an adversary*
consists of the **combined views** of **all** corrupt parties.

Distribution of Real-world random variable:
- $Real_{\pi} (\kappa, C; x_1, ..., x_n)$: run the protocol $\pi$ with security parameter $\kappa$, where each party $P_i$ runs the protocol honestly using private input $x_i$. Let $V_i$ denote the final view of party $P_i$, and let $y_i$ denote the final output of party $P_i$.

Output $\{ V_i | i \in C \}, (y_1, ..., y_n)$.

**Ideal World**: 
The *view of an adversary* in ideal world consists inputs sent to $\mathcal{T}$ and outputs received from $\mathcal{T}$. An ideal-world adversary must use this information to **generate** what looks like in the real-world, referred as **Simulator**.

Distribution of Ideal-world random variable:
- $Ideal_{\mathcal{F}, Sim} (\kappa, C; x_1, ..., x_n)$: Compute $(y_1, ..., y_n) \leftarrow \mathcal{F}(x_1, ..., x_n)$

Output $Sim(C, \{ (x_i, y_i) | i \in C \}), (y_1, ..., y_n)$.

### Semi-Honest Security
A protocol is secure against *semi-honest adversaries* if the corrupted parties in the real world have views that are **indistinguishable** from their views in the ideal world.

### Malicious Security
